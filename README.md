# Analyzing-visitor-traffic
Application created for Sonatel which became Orange senegal. It allowed them to control visitors coming in and out the site.
I developed this software for their security department in order to analyze the visitors traffic based on the floor, 
the building name and the reason of their visit. We gathered data for several months from visitors to help us 
make decisions such as restricting access to certain floor, provide more security, make predictions and 
much more.
